# React State Management Sample

A compact React 19 + Vite project that demonstrates:
- Local state with `useState`
- Minimal state / derived values
- Lifting state up (Accordion)
- Preserving & resetting state via keys (Messenger)
- Centralizing updates with `useReducer`
- Sharing data deeply with Context
- Combining reducer + context for global tasks

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open the printed local URL in your browser
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start dev server
- `npm run build` – build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview built app
